Get Dog (pictures) at your leisure.

When you click the 'Get Me a Dog!' button, you get a dog. Practicing making HTTP requests and continuing to learn React.

I'll soon be implementing functionality to show a list of previous dog pictures you've seen if you ever skip past one you just have to go back and look at some more.
Uses API from dog.ceo, "The internet's biggest collection of open source dog pictures".
